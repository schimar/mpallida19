# mpallida19

===================================================

This repository describes data analyses done by me for the manuscript of *Machilis pallida* bristletails population structure in the Eastern Alps of Austria and Italy. It is a collection of python and bash scripts for adapter trimming, mtDNA de-novo assembly, alignment, variant calling and filtering (and gbs2ploidy).
